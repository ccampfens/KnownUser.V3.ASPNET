##Downloading the Integration Configuration
The [IntegrationConfigProvider.cs](https://github.com/queueit/KnownUser.V3.Net_beta/blob/master/Documentation/IntegrationConfigProvider.cs) file is an example of how the download and caching of the configuration can be done. This is just an example, but if you make your own downloader, please cache the result for 5 minutes to limit number of download requests.
